# etch-a-sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum.
It was a fun project. I made use of all the skills I've learnt till this point
including manipulating events using event listeners or creating and appending
DOM elements using JS.
I even learned some new stuff like the filter property of styling and how to
generate random RGB values and implement the same using JS (which took me a while
to figure out.)

I also had my big-brain moment when I had trouble accessing the brightness value 
-> (element.style.filter = 'brightness()') in JS so instead I gave all the div units
a value attribute of 1 (to serve as brightness), and decremented them as well as the actual
brightness value by 0.1 upon each interaction in order to implement the progressive
darkening effect upon hovering.

This project was a valuable experience!
