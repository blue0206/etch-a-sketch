# etch-a-sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum.
It was a fun project. I made use of all the skills I've learnt till this point
including manipulating events using event listeners or creating and appending
DOM elements using JS.

This project was a valuable experience!
